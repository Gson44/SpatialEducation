            <p>The rise of technology is inevitable, poised to alter societal operations and individual 
                lifestyles. It is projected that, by 2030, the number of tech jobs will increase to a range of 
                50 to 100 million worldwide, contributing approximately $10 trillion to the economy annually. 
                Developments in Generative AI, Blockchain, Spatial Computing, the Metaverse, and IoT are expected to 
                have a profound impact on our lives.
